# K-Means-clustering-in-Python
This program will solve k-Means clustering in python with the assumed input hard-coded within the program. The inputs are group of points with (x,y) co-ordinates clustered into 2 (k=2). This k-Means program is hard-coded in python and is my first program too :) Thank you!!!
